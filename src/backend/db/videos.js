      "Over 60% of people in the world use Google Chrome as their main browser, so there's a good chance this video on the Top 8 Productivity Tips for Google Chrome is applicable to you 👍🏻\n\nIf you use a lot of Chrome extensions for work, did you know you could actually connect them to keyboard shortcuts of your choosing? Talk about an increase in productivity\n\nOR - if you don't want your work Chrome extensions in your personal Chrome account, you could create a Chrome User Profile that is COMPLETELY separate from your work Google account. This helped me become more efficient since I didn't have to toggle between 2 different browsers. \n\nWorkflow-wise, I like to keep related websites, links, online documents (i.e. for a single project) together in the same Bookmarks folder for easy access. I also like to keep the tabs I know I use all the time pinned to the left (Gmail, Calendar, Keep, Drive). \n\nAnd of course, we can't forget about Custom Search Engines on Chrome! You can literally search within any website - that has a search function built in - from the Google Chrome address bar, how cool is that?! 🤯\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Chrome Extension Shortcut Trick\n01:00 Bookmark Related Tabs Together\n02:00 Create Chrome User Profiles\n03:49 Add Custom Search Engines\n05:31 Use a Focused Work Window\n06:05 Quickly Find Specific Tabs\n06:56 Manage Tabs Efficiently\n07:34 Best Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts",

      "My review and one week impressions of the AirPods Max. Should I keep it or return it? p.s. there's no wrong answer here. If you like Apple's ecosystem, then this is a great buy, but if you're looking at this for music listening alone, this ain't it chief. \n\nAlright, so the AirPods Max is a very very expensive wireless headphones. At $549, you can buy two AirPods Pro for the price of one, so what's the deal? Is it any good? Then there's Sony's XM4's and Drop's THX Panda Headphones which are cheaper but also offers similar sounds. What I will tell you though is to set your expectations low, and work your way up. These headphones are NOT going to wow you in sound quality, but, Apple's Ecosystem is just so tight and convenient which other over the ear ANC-equipped headphones don't offer. ",

      "When we think about alien civilizations we tend to look into the vastness of space, to far away planets. But there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be giving too little thought to: time.\nCould it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years, other civilizations existed on earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out? And that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet? What does science have to say about this and what are the implications for us?",

To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who – to Thor’s surprise – inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.",

      "After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: “Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.” Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.",
